I am an open-source advocate and tech enthusiast. I'm always open to collaborating
with people on great projects. I spent the last years studying and applying new
software architectures, adding programming languages to my toolbox, doing deploys,
writing blog posts, traveling around the world, and doing many other things.

- 📝 I regularly write [articles](https://www.erdaltaskesen.com/blog/)
- 💬 Ask me anything [here](https://github.com/erdaltsksn/ama)
- 🔧 Check my [tech stack](https://stackshare.io/erdaltsksn/my-stack)

Whatever I do, I always do with a developer's mindset:

1. Analyze the problem
2. Break the one big problem into smaller sub-problems
3. Solve them one by one
4. Always search for a better solution
